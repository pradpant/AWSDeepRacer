# AWSDeepRacer
What is AWS DeepRacer?
It is way to try your the ML Model in HandsOn on building reinforcement learning models. .
Build your model, evaluate its performance on a virtual track, and then compete in the AWS DeepRacer League.

Traning:
AWS DeepRacer leverages Amazon SageMaker to train your model behind the scenes and uses AWS RoboMaker to simulate the agent's interaction with the environment. Watch how the agent behaves in the chosen environment, as prescribed by the reward function.
